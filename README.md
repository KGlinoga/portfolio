# portfolio
Initial build on a future portfolio. 

  This portfolio serves two purposes: 
    1. To demonstrate some proficiency in HTML, advanced CSS, and GitHub.
    2. To showcase current and future web development work for potential employers and clients.
  
  Although it does remain technically incomplete (more on this later) the webpage does satisfactorily accomplish both of the above goals. 
  
  Parts that remain incomplete: 
  
  The responsive page design could be more efficient and effective.  As a very new web development student, I will keep CSS in mind when planning future education, and devote more time and resources to learning these skills after Coding Boot Camp.  From these exercises I do have a strong appreciation for the work and expertise that CSS professionals have, and will carry that respect for them throughout my career moving forward.  I will be better able to communicate and collaborate with such professionals because of this experience. 
  
  There are only two of the five projects populated. This is also due to my current status as a very new web development student.  I have very few complete coding projects, and even fewer I would like to show future employers and clients.  However, this will be addressed soon as I complete more projects in and outside of Boot Camp, and I will populate the empty links as professional projects become available. 
  
  As I worked on this project, I was able to practice principles in HTML and CSS.  In HTML this was the first time I implemented semantic tags on a project I wrote from scratch, and learned that there are conventions to CSS selectors that I had not been following in the past.  These turned out to be the greatest hurdles to properly utilizing Flexbox principles in CSS, which is also an opportunity for improvement on this webpage.  
  
  I did successfly deploy :root variables in my CSS code, which made color styling much easier.
